How to GUIDE FOR NLP SCRIPT:

1. Setup Requirements
	Before using the script, ensure you have the necessary Python environment and packages installed.

	Python Installation: Ensure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

	Install Required Packages
		pip install pandas textblob transformers openpyxl

2. Download Models: (1)zero-shot-classification{facebook/bart-large-mnli} (2)text-classification{j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base} 

	The script uses the Hugging Face Transformers library models. The models are automatically downloaded when you run the script for the first time.


3. Understanding the Script
The script is structured into several key components:

Keyword Definitions: 			Define keywords and patterns for various categories (technical issues, countries, iMOW models, and emotions).

Helper Functions:
	detect_keywords_with_matches: 	Detects keywords in a text and returns matches.
	detect_keywords: 		Detects keywords in a text.
	categorize_comments: 		Main function that processes each comment and categorizes it based on various criteria.

Data Processing:
	process_new_data: 		Reads new data from the Excel file(updated Web crawled file), processes it, and saves the output(appends it)
	Main Function: 			Runs the script periodically every 2 hours to process new data.

A. Updating Keywords and Categories


technical_keywords, Countries, iMOW Models, Emotion Keywords: You can add the keywords to and their itereations as we added models in Web Crawling(Check How to for Web Crawling)

B. Adjusting Batch Size

"The batch size controls how many comments are processed at once, which can impact performance."

	To adjust the batch size, modify the batch_size variable in the categorize_comments function:
		
			batch_size = 8  # Increase or decrease based on your system's capabilities


C. Modifying Sentiment and Emotion Analysis
Sentiment Analysis: Adjust thresholds for sentiment classification within the categorize_comments function. Modify the sentiment polarity thresholds:

if sentiment < -0.1:
    sentiment_label = "negative"
elif sentiment > 0.1:
    sentiment_label = "positive"

Emotion Analysis: The emotion detection uses the Hugging Face Transformers library. If you want to change the model or adjust its output, modify the emotion_pipeline initialization:

		emotion_pipeline = pipeline('text-classification', model='j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base', top_k=None)


Normal Issue that could be faced and their troubleshooting:

PermissionError: If you see a PermissionError, ensure that the Excel file is not open in any application.

Memory Issues: If your system runs out of memory, consider reducing the batch_size or upgrading your system's RAM.

Python Environment Issues: If you encounter issues with missing packages or incorrect versions, create a new Python environment and reinstall the required packages.
